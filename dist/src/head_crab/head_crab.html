            <h1>Headcrab</h1>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>The Headcrab is a parasitic alien species. These creatures attach themselves to the heads of their victims and take control of their nervous systems, turning them into mindless zombies. <br><span class="tab"></span>Headcrabs
                are believed to have arrived on Earth via a portal opened by the alien race known as the Combine. They quickly spread and infested human populations, causing widespread panic and destruction. <br><span class="tab"></span>There are several
                different types of Headcrabs, each with its own unique abilities and traits. The standard Headcrab is a small, brownish-red creature with a spiky carapace and elongated limbs. It launches itself at its prey, attaching itself to their heads
                and injecting them with a venom that takes control of their nervous system. <br><span class="tab"></span>Other types of Headcrabs include the Poison Headcrab, which can spit a toxic substance at its prey, and the Fast Headcrab (also known
                as Crabhead), which moves at incredible speeds and is highly aggressive.</p>
