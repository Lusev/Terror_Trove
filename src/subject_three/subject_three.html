            <p><span class="tab"></span>Henry had always been an ordinary man, leading an unremarkable life. But one day, he was taken by a mad organization and subjected to horrific experiments that left him changed forever. <br><span class="tab"></span>His
                face had become shrunken and distorted, his body twisted and contorted. He had become a monster, a creature that was neither man nor beast. <br><span class="tab"></span>At first, Henry tried to hide from the world, ashamed of his new form.
                But as time went on, his hunger grew, a gnawing, insatiable hunger that could only be satisfied by flesh. <br><span class="tab"></span>He began to roam the streets at night, stalking his prey like a predator. He would attack his victims,
                tearing them apart with his razor-sharp teeth and devouring their flesh with a sickening relish. <br><span class="tab"></span>The people of the city lived in fear of the monster that lurked in the shadows, never knowing when it would strike
                next. But what they didn't know was that the monster was once a man, a man who had been twisted and turned into something unrecognizable by the cruel machinations of a mad organization.<br><span class="tab"></span> And so, Henry the monster
                continued to prowl the streets, his hunger driving him to ever more heinous acts of violence. He was a creature born of darkness, a symbol of the horrors that lurked just beneath the surface of the world.</p>
